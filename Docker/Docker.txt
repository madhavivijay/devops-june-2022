Docker 
	Docker is one of the tools that used the idea of the isolated resources to 
	create a container that allows applications to be packaged with all the 
	dependencies installed and ran wherever we wanted.
	
	Docker can only run on Linux machines this means I cant install Dokcer directly on Windows or any other OS.
	If I want install Docker on windows then I need to run a Linux VM in windows on top that I need to run Docker.

Virtualization (VM)
	- VM is way of running virtual OS on top a host OS using a special software called Hyperviser.
	- VM directly shares the harware of the host OS. 

					VM 					vs 			Containerisation 
	1. Virtualization at hardware level  		1. Virtualization at OS level 
	2. Heavyweight - consume more host 			2. Lightweight
	   resources 	
	3. VM useses hypervisor 					3. containerisation tool is used 
	4. limited performace - Boot up time        4. Native performace - usualy boot 
		is more which is in minutes 			   fast in seconds.
	5. Cosumes more storage 					5. Shres OS storage means only uses 
												   required storage.
	6. Supports all OS 							6. Supports on Linux

host machine 
	This is the machine in which docker is running 

Docker installation

1. Update ubuntu 
	sudo apt update 

2. Install support packages for Docker
	sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg lab-release

3. Need add key to download Docker 
	sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
	
	curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg	

4. Add docker packages to apt repository 
	echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

5. Install Docker 
	sudo apt-get update
 	sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin


Assignment: 1. Create docker hub account 

Login to your hub account 
	docker login 

Just try 
	STEP 1: create directory in /home/ubuntu/jenkins_home 
	STEP 2: docker run -it -d -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v /home/ubuntu/jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home jenkins/jenkins:lts
